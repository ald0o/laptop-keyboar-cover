# Laptop keyboard cover

This is an openscad model for a cover intended to be put over a laptop keyboard, so that you can lay your own ergo keyboard over it.

## Making your own

Current model is taylored for the ISO version of the Dell Latitude 5410. It would probably work with other Dell references as-is, and most laptops around with only a few modifications.

To build it: open the `.scad` file in OpenSCAD, render it (F6), export it to STL (F7). You can comment/uncomment the lines at the end of the file as to select either the whole cover, or only one of the two halves (purpose: 3D printing on a regular size FDM printer).

Pre-compiled STLs in the release section.

## What to expect

- a more stable sit for the ergo keyboard
- maybe prevention of accidental keypresses from the laptop keyboard

About the latter: there are better ways to avoid this, such as disabling the keyboard in software. Also if the cover is printed in flexible material such TPU, it is not guaranteed to prevent all accidental keypresses.

Last: if you use a split ergo keyboard on a desk or table, you would rather put the halves on the sides of the laptop, or maybe on its borders askew, as to create tenting. This cover is mostly useful for using the laptop... on your lap.
